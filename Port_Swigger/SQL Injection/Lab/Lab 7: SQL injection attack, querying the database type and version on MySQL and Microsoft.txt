Lab 7: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft.txt

Details: This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query. 

To Do: To solve the lab, display the database version string. 

Solution: 
	1. Use Burp Suite to intercept the request.
        2. Send the request to the repeter (ctrl+r) [it's easy to modify the request and view the result in the repeter]. You can do that in default "intercept" tab under "Proxy". It's totally optional. 
        3. Modify the 'category' parameter to " ' UNION SELECT NULL--".
        4. Add "NULL" to the query untill an valid 200 status request. 
                i.e. " ' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL--"
                        " ' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL--"
        5. When you will get a 200 status the number of "NULL" is the number of columns returned by the orginal query.
        6. Now put a specific STRING in the place of single a "NULL" and alternate the position untill got an valid 200 status request and determine which columns contain string.
        7. After determining which columns return string, use this injection "' UNION SELECT NULL,@@version#". As there are 2 columns in the orginal qurey and 1 column in the in the injection query, I fill the rest of 1 column position with the "NULL".
