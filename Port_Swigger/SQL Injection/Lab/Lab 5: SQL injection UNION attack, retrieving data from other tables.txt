Lab 5: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

Details:  This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.
The database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.

To Do: To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user. 

Sloution: 
        1. Use Burp Suite to intercept the request.
        2. Send the request to the repeter (ctrl+r) [it's easy to modify the request and view the result in the repeter]. You can do that in default "intercept" tab under "Proxy". It's totally optional. 
        3. Modify the 'category' parameter to " ' UNION SELECT NULL--".
        4. Add "NULL" to the query untill an valid 200 status request. 
                i.e. " ' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL--"
                        " ' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL--"
        5. When you will get a 200 status the number of "NULL" is the number of columns returned by the orginal query.
	6. Now put a specific STRING in the place of single a "NULL" and alternate the position untill got an valid 200 status request and determine which columns contain string.
	7. After determining which columns return string, use this injection "' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--". If there are more than 2 column then fill them with "NULL".
	8. Now use the information to log in as the administrator user.
