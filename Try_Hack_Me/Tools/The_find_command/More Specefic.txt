Most of the time, you wonâ€™t be looking for something in your working directory. The first argument of your find command should be the directory you want to search. The command will search in that directory and in all its subdirectories. So, if you want to search the whole filesystem, your command should begin with find /.


Two very useful flags are the -type and -name flags. With -type, you can use d to only find directories, and f to only find files. The -name flag is used to specify a name or pattern to look for. You can type the whole name, or use wildcards to specify only part(s) of the name. If you use wildcards, you need to enclose your pattern in quotes, otherwise the command won't work as intended. It is useful to know that you can also use the -iname flag; same as -name, but case insensitive.
