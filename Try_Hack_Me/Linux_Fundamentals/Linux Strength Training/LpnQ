(2020-08-13) Sarah: Hey Lucy, what happened to the database server? It is completely down now!

(2020-08-13) Lucy: Yes, I believe we have had a problem. I will need to investigate but for now there will be downtime for who knows how long.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is a shame, I needed to refer to a customerâ€™s record due to them being unhappy with our service yesterday. 

(2020-08-13) Lucy: if you ask Sameer, he may be able to help you find the back-up database copy we made a few hours ago? 

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Of course, he is one of the sql developers around here in charge of the database creation, I will ask him in a few minutes. Thank you.

(2020-08-13) Lucy: No problem. By the way, our new security engineer may have accidently stored the SSH password of one of our employees. I have no idea how to change it and he will not be back till tomorrow.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is a shame. I am sure we will all be fine till he returns. Do you know which employee it is? 

(2020-08-13) Lucy: I think it may have affected James but I not entirely sure.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: That is terrible, but I am sure nothing will come of it, he will be back tomorrow.

(2020-08-13) Lucy: True. It is just a concern of mine because James is the only one with root access. But as you said, we should be ok. Talk to you later. Bye.
