(2020-08-13) Sarah: Michael, I have been having trouble accessing the sql database back-up copy made today. Sameer gave me the password, but it just will not work?

(2020-08-13) Michael: Ah, yes. I remember, the security engineer was testing out a new automated software for creating sql database backups. He must have configured it to encrypt the backups with a different password.

(2020-08-13) Sarah: So how can I get a hold of it?

(2020-08-13) Michael: Good question. From what I remember the test program utilised a configuration file around 50mb. It is located inside the home/shared/sql/conf directory. This configuration file contained the directory location of a wordlist it used to randomly select a password from for encrypting the sql back-up copies with. 

(2020-08-13) Sarah: I do not really understand the last part?

(2020-08-13) Michael: once you find the configuration file and consequently the wordlist directory, visit it. One of those wordlists must contain the password it used for the testing. All I remember is that the password began with ebq. You will need Sameerâ€™s account. His SSH password is: thegreatestpasswordever000. 

(2020-08-13) Sarah: Thank you, I will try to find it.
