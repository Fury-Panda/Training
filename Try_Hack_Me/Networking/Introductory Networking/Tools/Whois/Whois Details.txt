Whois essentially allows you to query who a domain name is registered to. In Europe personal details are redacted; however, elsewhere you can potentially get a great deal of information from a whois search.

There is a web version of the whois (https://www.whois.com/whois/) tool if you're particularly adverse to the command line. Either way, let's get started!

Whois lookups are very easy to perform. Just use (  whois <domain>  ) to get a list of available information about the domain registration:

This is comparatively a very small amount of information as can often be found. Notice that we've got the domain name, the company that registered the domain, the last renewal, and when it's next due, and a bunch of information about nameservers (which we'll look at in the next task).
