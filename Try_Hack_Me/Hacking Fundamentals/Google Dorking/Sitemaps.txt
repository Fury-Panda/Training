Sitemaps

Comparable to geographical maps in real life, “Sitemaps” are just that - but for websites!

“Sitemaps” are indicative resources that are helpful for crawlers, as they specify the necessary routes to find content on the domain. The below illustration is a good example of the structure of a website, and how it may look on a "Sitemap":


The blue rectangles represent the route to nested-content, similar to a directory I.e. “Products” for a store. Whereas, the green rounded-rectangles represent an actual page. However, this is for illustration purposes only - “Sitemaps” don't look like this in the real world. They look something much more similar to this:


“Sitemaps” are XML formatted. I won't explain the structure of this file-formatting as the room XXE created by falconfeast does a mighty fine job of this.

The presence of "Sitemaps" holds a fair amount of weight in influencing the "optimisation" and favorability of a website. As we discussed in the "Search Engine Optimisation" task, these maps make the traversal of content much easier for the crawler!


Why are "Sitemaps" so Favourable for Search Engines?

Search engines are lazy! Well, better yet - search engines have a lot of data to process. The efficiency of how this data is collected is paramount. Resources like "Sitemaps" are extremely helpful for "Crawlers" as the necessary routes to content are already provided! All the crawler has to do is scrape this content - rather than going through the process of manually finding and scraping. Think of it as using a wordlist to find files instead of randomly guessing their names!


The easier a website is to "Crawl", the more optimised it is for the "Search Engine"
