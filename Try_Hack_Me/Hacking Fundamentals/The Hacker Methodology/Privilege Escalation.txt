After we have gained access to a victim machine via the exploitation phase, the next step is to escalate privileges to a higher user account. The following accounts are what we try to reach as a pentester:

    In the Windows world, the target account is usually: Administrator or System.
    In the Linux world, the target account is usually: root

As you can tell, discovering what Operating System a device is running on is very important to determine how we will escalate our privileges later. Once we gain access as a lower level user, we will try to run another exploit or find a way to become root or administrator.

Privilege escalation can take many, many forms, some examples are:

    Cracking password hashes found on the target
    Finding a vulnerable service or version of a service which will allow you to escalate privilege THROUGH the service
    Password spraying of previously discovered credentials (password re-use)
    Using default credentials
    Finding secret keys or SSH keys stored on a device which will allow pivoting to another machine
    Running scripts or commands to enumerate system settings like 'ifconfig' to find network settings, or the command 'find / -perm
    -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null' to see if the user has access to any commands they can run as root

These are just some examples of how privilege escalation could work and there are many more ways in which a privilege escalation could take place. Just think of this section of the methodology as getting to a higher-level user account or pivoting to another machine with the ultimate goal to "own" the machine.
