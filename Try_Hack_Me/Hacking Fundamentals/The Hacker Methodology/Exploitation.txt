Now that we have talked about the other three phases of a pentest, it is time to talk about the one that is often portrayed as "the coolest".

In the news, they often talk about "this hack" or "this vulnerability" but the truth is that usually the "exploitation" phase of a pentest is not as glamorous as it seems. The exploitation phase can only be as good as the recon and enumeration phases before it, if you did not enumerate all vulnerabilities you may miss an opportunity, or if you did not look hard enough at the target - the exploit you have chosen may fail entirely!

One common tool used for exploitation is called Metasploit which has many built-in scripts to try to keep life simple.

You can also used tools like Burp Suite and SQLMap to exploit web applications. There are tools such as msfvenom (for building custom payloads), BeEF (browser-based exploitation), and many many others.

      


TryHackMe has a ton of rooms dedicated to learning the basics of these tools, and I recommend learning from all of them!

For now, I think you have a good grasp on what "exploitation" means - just remember a professional penetration tester never jumps into the exploitation phase without doing adequate reconnaissance and enumeration.
