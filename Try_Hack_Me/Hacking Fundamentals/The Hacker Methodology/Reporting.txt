The final phase of the pentest methodology is the reporting phase.

This is one of the most important phases where you will outline everything that you found. The reporting phase often includes the following things:

    The Finding(s) or Vulnerabilities
    The CRITICALITY of the Finding
    A description or brief overview of how the finding was discovered
    Remediation recommendations to resolve the finding

The amount of reporting documentation varies widely by the type of engagement that the pentester is involved in. A findings report generally goes in three formats:

    Vulnerability scan results (a simple listing of vulnerabilities)
    Findings summary (list of the findings as outlined above)
    Full formal report.

As stated before there are many varying levels of documentation for a final written report. Here is how each type of reporting would look in practice:

    A vulnerability report usually looks like this: Analysing vulnerability scanning reports â€” Innovative Penetration Testing Services - Lean Security
    A findings summary is usually something like this:
        Finding: SQL Injection in ID Parameter of Cats Page
        Criticality: Critical
        Description: Placing a payload of 1' OR '1'='1 into the ID parameter of the website allowed the viewing of all cat names in the cat Table of the database. Furthermore, a UNION SELECT SQL statement allowed the attacker to view all usernames and passwords stored in the Accounts table. 
        Remediation Recommendation: Utilize a Prepared SQL statement to prevent SQL injection attacks

The CyberMentor has a lot of other good content such as example resumes, YouTube videos, and some really good Udemy courses (http://udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/) that will take you beyond the basics of this methodology outline.
