Most professional/ethical penetration testers never have the need to "cover their tracks". However, this is still a phase in the methodology.

You should always have explicit permission from the system owner regarding when the test is happening, how its occurring, and the scope of targets in any penetration test.

Since the rules of engagement for a penetration test should be agreed to before the test occurs, the penetration tester should stop IMMEDIATELY when they have achieved privilege escalation and report the finding to the client. 

As such, a professional will never cover their tracks because the assessment was planned to and agreed to beforehand. Although there are multiple tools for covering tracks, I will not talk about any of them in this room. If you are truly curious you may research them yourself.

However, even though you do not cover your tracks, this does not resolve you of liability for your exploitation. Often you will need to assist the IT Administrator or system owner in cleaning up the exploit code that you utilized, and also recommending HOW to prevent the attack in the future.

While ethical hackers rarely have a need to cover their tracks, you still must carefully track and notate all of the tasks that you performed as part of the penetration test to assist in fixing the vulnerabilities and recommending changes to the system owner.
