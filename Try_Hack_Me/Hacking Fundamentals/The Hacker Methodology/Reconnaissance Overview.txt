The first phase of the Ethical Hacker Methodology is Reconnaissance.

Reconnaissance is all about collecting information about your target.

Generally speaking, reconnaissance usually involves no interaction with the target(s) or system(s). 

Reconnaissance is a pretty simple concept, think about what tools we can use on the internet to gather information about people.

What websites and technology come to mind to gather information about a target organization, technology, or set of individuals?

In this case, lets use the company: SpaceX. Stop here and take 2 minutes to do some research on SpaceX and note down any websites you used to conduct research.


Where is the place that you started your research about SpaceX?

Most likely, you started at one of the most useful tools in a Hacker's possession:

    Google

Google is an incredibly useful tool, and there is an entire room (Google Dorking Room) to use it effectively to conduct research.

You might have also used websites such as Wikipedia to understand the history of SpaceX, used the company's Twitter/YouTube to see their latest news releases or "sizzle-reels", or even LinkedIn profile to research open company positions and/or the company's organizational structure.

The cool thing is, all of these very simple tools are all valid reconnaissance tools.

You might think hackers use special tools to conduct research (and in some cases that is true), but overall they use simple tools like these to conduct research.

Reconnaissance usually involves using publicly available tools like Google to conduct research about your target.

Even though it may seem simple, reconnaissance is the single most important phase of a penetration test.

There are some specialized tools that we can utilize but for this introduction it is good to know the following tools. 

    Google (specifically Google Dorking)
    Wikipedia
    PeopleFinder.com
    who.is
    sublist3r
    hunter.io
    builtwith.com
